/**
 * RATFIRE game audio — Web Audio sound manager.
 *
 * The suite is the user's pick plus their uploaded gun cues:
 *   rain-loop   "Heavy storm rain loop" (mixkit #2400)      /public/sfx/
 *   night-loop  "Wind blowing ambience" (mixkit #2658 WAV)  /public/sfx/
 *              — the NIGHT ambience channel, faded in with the moon
 *   shoot       user-uploaded gun SHOOTING sfx       /public/sfx/shoot.mp3
 *   reload      user-uploaded gun RELOAD sfx         /public/sfx/reload.mp3
 *   jump        user-uploaded ATHLETIC JUMP sfx      /public/sfx/jump.mp3
 *   roar        "Giant monster roar" (mixkit #1972 WAV) — the 5-key emote
 *   ignition    user-uploaded CAR IGNITION sfx (mixkit #1535 WAV) — the
 *              jeep's engine start (key turn + starter crank + catch),
 *              fired by enterJeep on every mount path
 *   chest       user-uploaded CHEST OPEN sfx — plays the INSTANT a loot
 *              chest / treasure box starts opening (the unlock cinematic:
 *              latch flip 0.38s + lid swing 0.67s finish in ~1s, so the
 *              sound accompanies the whole one-second opening); the SAME
 *              file played BACKWARDS (a sample-flipped copy, built once
 *              in the graph) rides the closing cinematic; the
 *              synthesized coin chime still stamps the loot burst
 * (the pre-existing /sounds/running-forest.wav footstep loop lives in
 * page.tsx as a plain HTMLAudioElement; the mute toggle covers ALL.)
 *
 * Autoplay-policy-proof architecture: the AudioContext is created LAZILY
 * inside the FIRST user gesture (any click / key press — the F fire key
 * qualifies). A context born during a gesture starts 'running' in every
 * browser — no resume() gamble. The raw file data is fetched lazily on
 * that same first gesture (fetch itself needs no gesture, but deferring
 * the download keeps ~14MB of audio bytes out of RAM while the player
 * idles in the lobby — decode timing relative to the consuming context
 * is unchanged). One-shots fired before the graph is ready only warm the
 * init — the next press plays. A missing file only silences its own cue;
 * audio can never break the game.
