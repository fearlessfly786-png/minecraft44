/**
 * CITY LAYOUT — shared constants + pure helpers for the big city road-map
 * plateau (the user's reference map cloned 1:1 into the grassland).
 *
 * The city is a 1536x1024-BLOCK rectangle of dead-flat ground in open
 * grassland, far from every landmark (probed against every biome
 * hand-zone — see the CITY_GRID note below). Everything
 * here is PURE MATH (no three.js) so the terrain height field, the
 * decor blockers, the minimap and the city builder itself can all
 * agree on one truth:
 *
 *  - cityEdgeT(gx, gz)        0 = plateau core, 1 = untouched nature,
 *                             smoothstep skirt between (terrainChunks
 *                             blends the height field with it)
 *  - cityColumnBlocked(gx,gz) the plateau core rect — decor systems
 *                             (loot chests, ground puddles) are kept out
 *  - cityMinimapTint(gx, gz)  road/walkway tint for the minimap canvas

 *  1536 wide x 1024 deep (2x the doubled build in each axis, 4x the
 *  area) — 153,600 x 102,400 world units = ~14 km x ~9.4 km (~128 km²)
 *  of city at the game's own toM() scale. The SAME reference network
 *  stretches across it (CITY_UPP doubled to 100 world units per image
 *  pixel), so the map, its roads and the open plots between them all
 *  scale up as one coherent giant. The rect kept the old SOUTH edge
 *  (gz1 = -1498) and the old x-centre (702.5) and grew NORTH + WEST +
 *  EAST — the only open directions (south is blocked by the cherry-ESE
 *  hand zone 214 blocks away). Probed clear of EVERY biome hand-zone
 *  at the modules' own worst-case reach (radius * 1.16 + 9): cherry-ESE
 *  kisses the south edge exactly as before (the city override owns the
 *  ground there anyway), volcano-S still clears 27 blocks, every other
 *  zone 40+ blocks clear. Terrain forces grassland inside the rect, so
 *  any natural biome country rolling underneath still reads as clean
